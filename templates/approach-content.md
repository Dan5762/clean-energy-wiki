## Theoretical Limits

### Primary Efficiency Limit

::: facet theoretical_limit
What fundamental limit governs maximum efficiency?
What is the numerical value of this limit for typical operating conditions?
:::

### Origin of the Limit

What physical principles give rise to this limit?
Is it thermodynamic, quantum mechanical, fluid dynamic, or another constraint?

<!-- For Carnot-limited technologies -->
<!-- 
The Carnot efficiency between the hot reservoir (T_h) and cold reservoir (T_c) is:

$$\eta_{\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h}$$

For this technology with T_h = X K and T_c = Y K:
$$\eta_{\text{Carnot}} = Z\%$$
