# Hydrothermal Geothermal Energy

## Earth's Internal Heat

### Origin of Geothermal Energy

::: facet ultimate_source
Geothermal energy derives from thermal energy stored within Earth's interior. This heat originates from two primary sources: primordial heat from planetary formation and ongoing radioactive decay of isotopes in the mantle and crust.
:::

**Primordial heat:**

When Earth formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago, several processes generated enormous thermal energy:

1. **Accretion heating:** As planetesimals and protoplanetary material collided and merged, kinetic energy converted to heat
2. **Gravitational compression:** The increasing mass of the growing planet compressed interior material, raising temperatures
3. **Core differentiation:** As dense iron and nickel sank to form the core, gravitational potential energy released as heat

This primordial heat has been slowly dissipating ever since, but Earth's insulating crust and mantle retain substantial residual thermal energy.

**Radioactive decay:**

The decay of long-lived radioactive isotopes continuously generates heat within Earth:

| Isotope | Half-life (billion years) | Heat production |
|---------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Uranium-238 (²³⁸U) | 4.47 | ~40% of radiogenic heat |
| Uranium-235 (²³⁵U) | 0.70 | ~4% |
| Thorium-232 (²³²Th) | 14.0 | ~40% |
| Potassium-40 (⁴⁰K) | 1.25 | ~16% |

These isotopes are concentrated in the crust and mantle. As they undergo alpha and beta decay, they release energy that converts to thermal energy through particle interactions with surrounding rock.

**Heat budget:**

Earth's total internal heat flow to the surface is approximately 44.2 terawatts (TW), comprising:
- Radiogenic heat production: ~30 TW (60-70%)
- Primordial heat loss: ~14 TW (30-40%)

For comparison, total human energy consumption is approximately 18 TW. Earth's internal heat flow far exceeds human energy needs, though only a small fraction is practically accessible.

Early in Earth's history, radiogenic heating was much greater because short-lived isotopes had not yet decayed. Heat production 3 billion years ago was approximately twice present-day levels, driving more vigorous mantle convection and plate tectonics.

### The Geothermal Gradient

Temperature increases with depth below Earth's surface. This rate of temperature increase is called the geothermal gradient.

**Average gradient:**

In most continental crust, temperature rises at approximately:

::: equation geothermal_gradient
$$\frac{dT}{dz} \approx 25-30°C/km$$
:::

This means:
- At 1 km depth: ~40-50°C (accounting for surface temperature)
- At 3 km depth: ~100-120°C
- At 10 km depth: ~300-350°C

**Variation by tectonic setting:**

| Setting | Gradient (°C/km) | Examples |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| Stable continental interior | 15-25 | Canadian Shield, Siberian Craton |
| Normal continental | 25-30 | Most continents |
| Sedimentary basins | 30-40 | Gulf Coast, North Sea |
| Active margins | 40-80 | Cascades, Andes |
| Volcanic/rift zones | 80-200+ | Iceland, East African Rift |
| Mid-ocean ridges | 100-300+ | Mid-Atlantic Ridge |

Areas with elevated geothermal gradients are prime targets for geothermal power development. Volcanic regions, rift zones, and tectonic plate boundaries concentrate accessible high-temperature resources.

**Heat flow:**

Heat flows from Earth's interior to the surface via conduction and convection:

::: equation heat_flow
$$q = -k\frac{dT}{dz}$$
:::

Where:
- q = heat flux (W/m²)
- k = thermal conductivity of rock (~2-4 W/m·K)
- dT/dz = geothermal gradient

Average surface heat flow:
- Continental crust: ~65 mW/m²
- Oceanic crust: ~101 mW/m²
- Global average: ~87 mW/m² (0.087 W/m²)

This is roughly 0.03% of the solar energy absorbed by Earth's surface, illustrating why direct surface heat collection is impractical. Geothermal energy extraction requires accessing concentrated subsurface heat.

### Temperature Profile Through Earth

| Layer | Depth (km) | Temperature |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Surface | 0 | ~15°C (average) |
| Upper crust | 0-15 | 15-400°C |
| Lower crust | 15-35 | 400-1000°C |
| Upper mantle | 35-660 | 1000-1900°C |
| Lower mantle | 660-2890 | 1900-3500°C |
| Outer core | 2890-5150 | 3500-5000°C |
| Inner core | 5150-6371 | 5000-6000°C |

The lithosphere (crust and uppermost mantle, ~100 km thick) transfers heat primarily by conduction, creating steep temperature gradients. Below, the convecting mantle maintains a nearly adiabatic temperature profile with much gentler gradients (~0.3°C/km).

## Hydrothermal Systems

### Definition and Requirements

::: facet geographic_constraint
Hydrothermal systems are naturally occurring underground reservoirs where water or steam has been heated by proximity to hot rock. To generate electricity from a hydrothermal resource, three elements must coexist:
:::

1. **Heat source:** Hot rock (typically >150°C for electricity generation)
2. **Fluid:** Water or steam to transport heat
3. **Permeability:** Fractures or porous rock allowing fluid circulation

When all three elements naturally occur together, the system is called a "conventional hydrothermal resource." These represent the most economically exploitable geothermal resources.

### Types of Hydrothermal Reservoirs

**Vapor-dominated (dry steam) systems:**

Rare but highly valuable. The reservoir contains superheated steam rather than liquid water.

Characteristics:
- Reservoir temperature: 230-250°C
- Pressure: Below saturation pressure for the temperature
- Steam produced directly at wellhead
- Very efficient for power generation

Examples: The Geysers (California), Larderello (Italy), Kamojang (Indonesia)

Only about 5% of known hydrothermal resources are vapor-dominated, but they produce approximately 50% of global geothermal electricity due to their superior thermodynamic properties.

**Liquid-dominated (hot water) systems:**

Most common type. The reservoir contains pressurized hot water.

Characteristics:
- Temperature range: 150-350°C
- Water remains liquid under reservoir pressure
- "Flashes" to steam when pressure drops at surface
- Some systems are two-phase (water + steam)

High-temperature liquid-dominated systems (>180°C) can use flash steam technology. Lower-temperature systems require binary cycle plants.

**Geopressured systems:**

Deep sedimentary formations containing hot water under very high pressure, often with dissolved methane.

Characteristics:
- Depth: 3-6 km
- Temperature: 150-200°C
- Pressure: 70-100 MPa (10,000-15,000 psi)
- Contain dissolved methane (energy bonus)

Found along Gulf Coast of USA. Not commercially developed due to technical challenges.

### Reservoir Characteristics

**Temperature:**

Minimum temperatures for electricity generation:
- Dry steam plants: >180°C
- Flash steam plants: >180°C (preferably >230°C)
- Binary cycle plants: >100°C (practical minimum ~120-150°C)

Higher temperatures enable higher thermodynamic efficiency and more economical power generation.

**Flow rate:**

Sufficient fluid flow is essential. Production wells typically require:
- Flow rate: 50-200 tonnes/hour per well
- Wellhead pressure: 5-25 bar (flash) or 10-50 bar (dry steam)

Flow rate depends on reservoir permeability, well design, and drawdown management.

**Depth:**

Hydrothermal wells typically range from:
- Shallow (volcanic): 500-1500 m
- Standard: 1500-3000 m
- Deep: 3000-5000 m

Drilling costs increase roughly exponentially with depth, making shallow high-temperature resources most economical.

**Chemistry:**

Geothermal fluids contain dissolved minerals and gases:

| Component | Concentration | Issues |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Silica (SiO₂) | 100-1000 ppm | Scaling in pipes, equipment |
| Chloride | 100-100,000 ppm | Corrosion |
| CO₂ | 0.1-5% | Emissions, pH effects |
| H₂S | 0.01-2% | Toxic emissions, corrosion |
| Arsenic | 0.1-50 ppm | Environmental concern |
| Mercury | ppb levels | Environmental concern |

Fluid chemistry significantly affects plant design, materials selection, and environmental management.

## Power Plant Technologies

::: facet conversion_pathway
Geothermal power plants convert thermal energy from subsurface reservoirs into electricity through steam turbines or binary cycle systems, using water or organic working fluids as the heat transfer medium.
:::

### Dry Steam Plants

**Principle:**

Steam from the reservoir flows directly through the turbine. No phase change required at surface.

**Process:**
1. Production wells tap steam reservoir
2. Steam passes through rock catcher (removes large debris)
3. Centrifugal separator removes moisture and particulates
4. Steam drives turbine connected to generator
5. Exhaust steam condenses in condenser
6. Condensate reinjected or used for cooling

**Thermodynamics:**

For dry steam at typical conditions (180-250°C, 5-15 bar):

Ideal Carnot efficiency:

::: equation carnot_efficiency
$$\eta_{Carnot} = 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h} = 1 - \frac{313K}{523K} \approx 40\%$$
:::

Actual efficiency: 20-30% (accounting for irreversibilities)

**Characteristics:**
- Simplest plant design
- Highest efficiency among geothermal technologies
- Limited to rare vapor-dominated resources
- Typical plant size: 20-100 MW per unit

**Major installations:**

| Site | Location | Capacity | Notes |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| The Geysers | California, USA | 1,517 MW | World's largest geothermal complex |
| Larderello | Tuscany, Italy | ~800 MW | First geothermal power (1904) |
| Kamojang | Java, Indonesia | 200 MW | Oldest in Indonesia (1975) |
| Matsukawa | Japan | 23.5 MW | Only dry steam in Japan |

### Flash Steam Plants

**Principle:**

High-pressure hot water from the reservoir "flashes" to steam when pressure drops. The steam drives the turbine.

**Single-flash process:**
1. Production well brings pressurized hot water to surface
2. Water enters flash separator (lower pressure than reservoir)
3. Portion of water vaporizes ("flashes") to steam
4. Steam separated from remaining liquid (brine)
5. Steam drives turbine
6. Brine and condensed steam reinjected

**Flash physics:**

When pressure drops below saturation pressure, water partially vaporizes. The flash fraction depends on initial temperature and flash pressure:

::: equation flash_fraction
$$x_{flash} = \frac{h_1 - h_f}{h_{fg}}$$
:::

Where:
- x_flash = mass fraction that flashes to steam
- h₁ = enthalpy of incoming fluid
- h_f = liquid enthalpy at flash pressure
- h_fg = latent heat of vaporization at flash pressure

For water at 250°C flashing to 1 bar: ~15-20% becomes steam.

**Double-flash process:**

The brine from the first flash separator enters a second, lower-pressure separator for additional steam extraction.

Benefits:
- 15-25% more power than single-flash
- Better utilization of geothermal fluid
- More complex plant, higher capital cost

**Triple-flash:**

A third stage extracts even more energy. Used where very high-temperature resources justify added complexity.

**Efficiency:**

| Configuration | Efficiency | Typical temperature |
|---------------|------------|---------------------|
| Single-flash | 10-15% | 180-250°C |
| Double-flash | 15-20% | 230-300°C |
| Triple-flash | 18-25% | >280°C |

**Characteristics:**
- Most common geothermal technology (~65% of global capacity)
- Requires high-temperature resources (>180°C)
- Plant sizes: 5-150 MW per unit
- Some emissions (CO₂, H₂S) from flashed steam

### Binary Cycle Plants

**Principle:**

Geothermal fluid heats a secondary working fluid with lower boiling point. The working fluid vaporizes and drives the turbine. Geothermal fluid never contacts turbine.

**Process:**
1. Geothermal fluid (hot water) pumped from well
2. Passes through heat exchanger
3. Transfers heat to organic working fluid
4. Working fluid vaporizes at lower temperature than water
5. Vapor drives turbine connected to generator
6. Working fluid condenses, recirculates (closed loop)
7. Cooled geothermal fluid reinjected

**Working fluids:**

| Fluid | Boiling point | Critical temp | Applications |
|-------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Isobutane | -12°C | 135°C | Most common |
| Isopentane | 28°C | 187°C | Higher temp resources |
| R-134a | -26°C | 101°C | Low temp resources |
| R-245fa | 15°C | 154°C | Medium temp |
| Ammonia | -33°C | 132°C | Kalina cycle |

The Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is the standard binary configuration. The Kalina cycle uses ammonia-water mixture and can achieve slightly higher efficiency but greater complexity.

**Efficiency:**

Binary plants operate at lower temperatures, limiting thermodynamic efficiency:

| Resource temp | Binary efficiency |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 100°C | 5-8% |
| 120°C | 8-10% |
| 150°C | 10-13% |
| 180°C | 12-15% |

**Characteristics:**
- Can utilize lower-temperature resources (100-180°C)
- Zero emissions (closed loop, no contact with atmosphere)
- CO₂ in geofluid remains sequestered
- Smaller unit sizes: 1-50 MW typical
- Higher capital cost per kW than flash
- ~90% of new US geothermal plants since 2000

**Advantages over flash:**
- Applicable to moderate-temperature resources
- No direct emissions
- Works with corrosive/scaling fluids (isolated by heat exchanger)
- Modular, scalable design

### Combined Cycle and Hybrid Systems

**Combined flash-binary:**

High-temperature resources can use flash for initial power extraction, then binary cycle on the remaining brine.

Benefits:
- 10-20% more power than flash alone
- Better resource utilization
- Common in high-temperature fields

**Geothermal-solar hybrid:**

Solar thermal energy supplements geothermal heat, boosting fluid temperature and power output.

**Geothermal-biomass hybrid:**

Biomass combustion supplements geothermal heat for higher efficiency.

## Thermodynamic Analysis

::: facet theoretical_limit
Geothermal power conversion is fundamentally limited by the Carnot efficiency, which depends on the temperature difference between the hot reservoir and the cold sink. Lower geothermal temperatures compared to combustion-based plants result in lower theoretical maximum efficiencies (typically 26-45%).
:::

### Carnot Efficiency Limit

Maximum theoretical efficiency for any heat engine:

::: limitation carnot
$$\eta_{Carnot} = 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h}$$
:::

Where temperatures are in Kelvin.

| Hot side (°C) | Cold side (°C) | Carnot limit |
|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| 150 | 40 | 26% |
| 200 | 40 | 34% |
| 250 | 40 | 40% |
| 300 | 40 | 45% |

Geothermal plants typically achieve 40-60% of Carnot efficiency due to:
- Irreversibilities in heat exchange
- Turbine inefficiency
- Parasitic loads (pumps, fans)
- Practical temperature differences required

### Exergy Analysis

Exergy (available work) better characterizes geothermal resource quality than energy alone.

Specific exergy of geothermal fluid:

::: equation specific_exergy
$$e = (h - h_0) - T_0(s - s_0)$$
:::

Where:
- h, s = enthalpy and entropy of geofluid
- h₀, s₀ = reference state (ambient conditions)
- T₀ = ambient temperature (K)

Higher-temperature resources have higher specific exergy and greater power potential per unit mass flow.

### Utilization Efficiency

Geothermal utilization efficiency compares actual power output to exergy input:

::: equation utilization_efficiency
$$\eta_u = \frac{W_{net}}{E_{in}} = \frac{W_{net}}{\dot{m} \cdot e}$$
:::

Typical values:
- Dry steam: 50-70%
- Flash steam: 35-50%
- Binary: 25-45%

### Parasitic Loads

Geothermal plants have significant auxiliary power requirements:

| Component | % of gross output |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Production well pumps | 5-15% |
| Injection pumps | 2-5% |
| Cooling system | 5-15% |
| Working fluid pumps (binary) | 3-8% |
| Gas extraction | 1-3% |
| **Total parasitic** | **15-40%** |

Low-temperature binary plants have the highest parasitic loads (up to 40% of gross), significantly reducing net output.

## Global Deployment

### Installed Capacity

As of year-end 2024, global hydrothermal geothermal power capacity reached approximately 15-17 GW across 28-35 countries.

**Top 10 countries (2024):**

| Rank | Country | Capacity (MW) | % of national electricity |
|------|---------|---------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | United States | 3,937 | <1% |
| 2 | Indonesia | 2,653 | ~5% |
| 3 | Philippines | 1,984 | ~12% |
| 4 | Türkiye | 1,734 | ~3% |
| 5 | New Zealand | 1,207 | ~18% |
| 6 | Kenya | 985 | ~45% |
| 7 | Mexico | 976 | ~2% |
| 8 | Italy | 916 | ~2% |
| 9 | Iceland | 786 | ~25% |
| 10 | Japan | 576 | <1% |

### Historical Development

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1904 | First geothermal electricity at Larderello, Italy (experimental) |
| 1911 | First commercial geothermal plant, Larderello (250 kW) |
| 1958 | Wairakei, New Zealand (first large flash plant) |

| 2010 | Global capacity: ~11 GW |
| 2020 | Global capacity: ~14 GW |
| 2024 | Global capacity: ~16-17 GW |

Growth has been modest compared to solar and wind, averaging ~3-5% annually. The geographic limitation to tectonically active regions constrains expansion.

## Economics

### Capital Costs

Geothermal power is capital-intensive. Major cost components:

| Component | % of total | Cost drivers |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Exploration | 10-15% | Surveys, test wells, risk |
| Drilling | 30-50% | Depth, geology, well count |
| Power plant | 25-35% | Technology, capacity |
| Steam gathering | 10-15% | Piping, separators |
| Transmission | 5-10% | Distance to grid |

**Total installed costs (2020-2024):**

| Region/type | $/kW |
|-------------|------|
| Global weighted average | $3,500-4,500 |
| Flash (high-temp) | $2,500-4,000 |
| Binary (moderate-temp) | $3,500-5,500 |
| Best projects | $2,000-2,500 |
| Challenging projects | $5,000-7,000 |

Costs have not declined as dramatically as solar/wind due to:
- Site-specific geology (no standardization)
- Drilling technology improvements slower than solar manufacturing
- Limited scale compared to other renewables

### Operating Costs

Geothermal has relatively low operating costs but requires ongoing reservoir management:

| Component | $/MWh |
|-----------|-------|
| Operations & maintenance | $10-20 |
| Well workover/replacement | $5-15 |
| Make-up wells (field decline) | $5-20 |
| Royalties/land lease | $2-5 |
| **Total O&M** | **$20-50** |

Unlike fossil fuels, geothermal has no fuel cost, but reservoirs require active management to maintain production.

### Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE)

**Global average LCOE (2022-2024):**

$$LCOE \approx \$0.05-0.08/kWh$$

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| IRENA global weighted average (2022) | $0.056/kWh |
| Range (project-dependent) | $0.04-0.14/kWh |
| Geothermal hotspots (Iceland, etc.) | $0.04-0.06/kWh |
| Moderate-temp binary | $0.08-0.12/kWh |

Geothermal LCOE is competitive with fossil fuels and other renewables in favorable locations, but higher than utility-scale solar/wind in most markets.

### Capacity Factor

Geothermal's key economic advantage is high capacity factor:

| Technology | Capacity factor |
|------------|-----------------|
| Geothermal | 80-95% |
| Nuclear | 90-93% |
| Natural gas CC | 40-60% |
| Coal | 40-80% |
| Hydropower | 30-50% |
| Wind (onshore) | 25-45% |
| Solar PV | 15-25% |

High capacity factor means geothermal plants generate electricity nearly continuously, providing baseload power. This partially offsets higher capital costs.

**Annual generation:**

A 100 MW geothermal plant at 90% capacity factor produces:
$$100 MW \times 8760 h \times 0.90 = 788,400 MWh/year$$

A 100 MW solar plant at 20% capacity factor produces:
$$100 MW \times 8760 h \times 0.20 = 175,200 MWh/year$$

Geothermal produces 4.5× more energy per MW installed.

### Exploration Risk

Geothermal development faces unique exploration risk:

- Drilling costs: $1-5 million per well
- Success rate: 50-80% for production-grade wells
- Several wells typically needed per MW
- Early-stage exploration can be 15-30% of total cost
- Risk concentrated before revenue begins

This front-loaded risk profile deters some investors. Government risk mitigation programs (e.g., drilling insurance, exploration grants) can facilitate development.

## Environmental Aspects

### Emissions

**CO₂ emissions:**

Geothermal plants emit some CO₂ dissolved in geofluids:

| Plant type | g CO₂/kWh |
|------------|-----------|
| Binary (closed loop) | ~0 (operational) |
| Flash/dry steam (open) | 15-55 |
| High-CO₂ fields | Up to 200 |
| Global average | ~45 |
| Natural gas combined cycle | ~400 |
| Coal | ~900 |

Binary plants with reinjection have near-zero operational emissions. Flash and dry steam plants release CO₂ from the geofluid, though far less than fossil fuels.

Some plants (Iceland, New Zealand) reinject CO₂ back into reservoirs, approaching zero emissions even for flash systems.

**H₂S emissions:**

Hydrogen sulfide is toxic and malodorous. Modern plants use:
- Gas extraction systems
- Chemical scrubbing (Stretford, LO-CAT processes)
- Reinjection

Typical H₂S emissions reduced to <1 kg/MWh with abatement.

**Lifecycle emissions:**

Including construction, drilling, and operations:
- Geothermal: 15-55 g CO₂eq/kWh
- Wind: 7-15 g CO₂eq/kWh
- Solar PV: 20-50 g CO₂eq/kWh
- Natural gas: 400-500 g CO₂eq/kWh

### Water Use

Geothermal water use is complex:

**Open-loop systems (flash/dry steam):**
- Extract geofluid, some lost to evaporation
- Cooling towers evaporate water
- Net water consumption: 5-20 L/kWh

**Closed-loop binary:**
- Geofluid reinjected (minimal loss)
- Cooling still requires water
- Some use air cooling (zero water, lower efficiency)

**Reservoir sustainability:**

Long-term extraction can deplete reservoirs:
- Steam pressure decline
- Temperature reduction
- Chemical changes

Reinjection of extracted fluids and supplemental water (wastewater, treated effluent) maintains reservoir pressure. The Geysers uses 20 million gallons/day of treated wastewater to sustain production.

### Land Use

Geothermal has modest land footprint:

| Component | Land use |
|-----------|----------|
| Power plant | 1-5 hectares per 100 MW |
| Well pads | 0.1-0.5 ha each |
| Steam gathering | Pipelines across field |
| **Total** | **10-50 ha per 100 MW** |

Comparable to or less than solar/wind per unit energy produced, given high capacity factor.

### Induced Seismicity

Fluid injection can trigger small earthquakes:

| Activity | Risk level | Magnitude |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Production (extraction) | Low | Generally <2.0 |
| Reinjection | Moderate | Typically <3.0 |
| EGS stimulation | Higher | Up to 3-4+ |

Conventional hydrothermal operations rarely cause felt earthquakes. Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), which require hydraulic stimulation, pose greater seismic risk (addressed in separate article).

Basel, Switzerland (2006): EGS project cancelled after M3.4 earthquake
The Geysers: Frequent M2-3 events, rare M4+, managed through injection protocols

Monitoring and adaptive management can reduce seismic risk.

### Thermal and Chemical Pollution

**Thermal discharge:**

Cooling water discharge can affect local water bodies. Air cooling eliminates this but reduces efficiency.

**Brine disposal:**

Extracted brines contain dissolved minerals (silica, heavy metals). Proper reinjection prevents surface contamination.

**Scaling and corrosion:**

Mineral precipitation (silite, calcite) and corrosion products must be managed to prevent equipment failure and ensure fluid does not contaminate surface environment.

## Dispatchability and Grid Services

### Baseload Power

::: facet temporal_character
Geothermal provides continuous, reliable baseload electricity:
:::

- 24/7 generation (unlike solar/wind)
- Unaffected by weather
- Predictable output
- High availability (95%+)

This makes geothermal valuable for grid stability, especially as variable renewables increase.

### Flexibility

Modern geothermal plants can provide limited flexibility:

- Load following: 50-100% range
- Ramp rate: 2-5% per minute (slower than gas turbines)
- Frequency regulation: Limited capability
- Reserve capacity: Can provide spinning reserve

While less flexible than gas turbines, geothermal can adjust output to complement variable renewables.

### Ancillary Services

Geothermal plants can provide:
- Voltage support (synchronous generators)
- Inertia (rotating mass)
- Black start capability (some plants)

These grid services become more valuable as synchronous fossil generation retires.

## Future Outlook

### Growth Projections

| Scenario | 2030 capacity | 2050 capacity |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Current trend | 20-25 GW | 30-40 GW |
| Accelerated (with EGS) | 30-40 GW | 60-90 GW |
| High ambition (DOE GeoVision) | - | 60 GW (US alone) |

Growth depends heavily on:
- Enhanced Geothermal Systems development
- Cost reductions in drilling
- Policy support
- Successful new market development

### Technology Improvements

**Drilling:**
- Advanced drill bits (PDC, hybrid)
- Automated drilling systems
- High-temperature electronics
- Millimeter-wave drilling (experimental)

Target: 50% reduction in drilling costs could double economically viable resources.

**Power conversion:**
- Supercritical CO₂ cycles
- Advanced organic fluids
- Higher-efficiency turbines
- Improved heat exchangers

**Exploration:**
- Machine learning for resource prediction
- Advanced geophysical imaging
- Distributed fiber-optic sensing
- Reduced exploration risk

### Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS)

EGS creates artificial reservoirs in hot dry rock by hydraulic stimulation. This could vastly expand geothermal potential beyond natural hydrothermal sites.

Key developments:
- Fervo Energy: Successful EGS demonstration in Nevada (2023)
- Utah FORGE: DOE research site advancing EGS techniques
- European projects: Soultz, Rittershoffen demonstrating viability

EGS could enable geothermal anywhere with sufficient geothermal gradient, potentially increasing global potential from ~200 GW (hydrothermal) to 2,000+ GW.

### Supercritical Geothermal

Accessing supercritical fluids (>374°C, >22 MPa for water) could dramatically increase power output per well:

- IDDP project (Iceland): Drilled to 4.5 km, encountered 450°C+ fluids
- Potential: 10× power per well compared to conventional

Technical challenges remain (materials, well control), but success could transform geothermal economics.

### Strengths and Limitations

**Strengths:**
- Baseload, dispatchable power (24/7)
- High capacity factor (80-95%)
- Low emissions (especially binary)
- Small land footprint per MWh
- Long plant life (30-50 years)
- Domestic resource (energy security)
- Combined heat and power possible

**Limitations:**
- Geographically constrained (tectonic regions)
- High upfront capital cost
- Exploration risk (drilling before revenue)
- Slow development timeline (5-10 years)
- Limited scalability compared to solar/wind
- Potential induced seismicity
- Reservoir depletion risk

### Role in Energy Transition

Hydrothermal geothermal energy occupies a valuable but constrained niche in the global energy system:

**Current role:**
- Provides reliable baseload power in favorable regions
- Critical energy source for Kenya, Iceland, Philippines, El Salvador
- Complements variable renewables with firm capacity
- ~0.3% of global electricity

**Future potential:**
- Conventional hydrothermal: Limited by geography (~200 GW global potential)
- With EGS: Potential 10× expansion to most continental regions
- Could provide 3-5% of global electricity by 2050 with aggressive development

Geothermal's unique value lies in providing carbon-free baseload power. As grids integrate more solar and wind, firm dispatchable resources become increasingly valuable. Hydrothermal geothermal, combined with emerging EGS technology, can fill this role in many regions, complementing variable renewables and contributing to deep decarbonization of electricity systems.
